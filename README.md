# 📌 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) 🚀
Welcome! This repository was created to explore and implement Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) in depth. Instead of using built-in classes, I am implementing my own structures from scratch to better understand various algorithms and data structures.

This repo is not limited to Linked Lists; it will also cover other data structures and algorithms. The main goal is to understand DSA concepts thoroughly and build them from scratch.

# 📌 Available Data Structures
✅ Linked List
🔹 Singly Linked List

# 📌 Upcoming Implementations:
🔜 Doubly Linked List
🔜 Circular Linked List
🔜 Stack
🔜 Queue
🔜 Trees (Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree)
🔜 Graphs
🔜 Sorting & Searching Algorithms
... and more!

🚀 How to Use?
This repository is open for learning, improving, and using in your own projects!
Usage Instructions:
1️⃣ Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/DSA.git
2️⃣ Explore and run the code.
3️⃣ Improve your understanding and apply it in your own projects.

If you find this repository helpful, don't forget to ⭐ star it! 😊

# 🔍 Why am I not using built-in classes?
My primary goal is to gain a deep understanding of DSA.
Standard libraries (such as List<T>, LinkedList<T>, etc.) are powerful and provide extensive functionalities. However, this repository is focused on understanding how these structures work internally and building them from scratch.
By writing my own classes, I aim to understand the core principles of data structures more effectively. This approach is also beneficial for technical interviews and problem-solving.
