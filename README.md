# 📚 Data Structures & Algorithms Repository
Welcome to the Data Structures & Algorithms repository! This project is designed to help developers learn, implement, and improve their understanding of various data structures and algorithms. 
Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, you will find useful code implementations here for practice and learning.

✅ Implemented Data Structures:
- Singly Linked List : A simple implementation of a singly linked list.

# 🔜 Upcoming Implementations:

- Doubly Linked List: Implementing a doubly linked list with both forward and backward traversal.
- Circular Linked List: Creating a linked list where the last node points back to the first node.
- Stack: LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure implementation.
- Queue: FIFO (First In, First Out) data structure implementation.
- Binary Tree: A tree structure with nodes having at most two children.
- Binary Search Tree (BST): A binary tree where nodes are arranged in a way that allows for efficient searching.
- Graphs: Exploring graph structures with different traversal algorithms.
- Sorting & Searching Algorithms: Implementations of common sorting and searching algorithms.
... and more!: Stay tuned for more additions!
